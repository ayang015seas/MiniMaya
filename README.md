# MiniMaya
Mini version of the maya editing software built in OpenGL. Allows user to interact with, load json meshes, and also manipulate meshes using skeletons. We use C++ and OpenGL to creating a half-edge data structure from interlinked pointers and then visualize your mesh using OpenGL vertex buffers. This assignment will be the first of three in creating a mesh editor application in the style of Autodesk Maya or Blender.
